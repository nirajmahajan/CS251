## CS 251 Autumn 2019 Inlab 1 Autograder Script

Instructions for using the script :
1. Place your script file (not tar or gzip file just the script file) i.e., <roll no>-lab1-inlab.script in the master folder and run ./evaluate.sh
2. You should see the output as   <roll_no>       <keywords_missing_in_your_script>      <partA marks>     <partB marks>
3. Here Part A checks if your script contains certain keywords or not and partB checks the size of your script.
4. Note that this inlab is graded leniently as this is the first inlab and we just checked if you tried various commands or not.
